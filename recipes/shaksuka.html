    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots of bread to soak up the sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1⅓ cups chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly slice bell pepper, any color</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
        <li>2½ cups chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together tomatoes, chile pepper, cumin, paprika, and salt in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Stir tomato mixture into onion mixture. Simmer, uncovered, until tomato juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Make 4 indentations in tomato mixture; crack eggs into indentations. Cover the skillet and cook until eggs are firm but not dry, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! </li> 
    </ol>
