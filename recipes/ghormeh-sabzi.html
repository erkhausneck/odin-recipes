    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ghormeh sabzi is deliciously savory and loaded with the flavors of several different green herbs. It's traditionally served atop white rice (polow). You can also serve it with lavash bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless chuck roast, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped green onions (green part only)</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped chives</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fenugreek leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>4 dried Persian limes (limoo amani), or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in turmeric for 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add chuck cubes; cook until coated in turmeric and browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a separate pot over medium heat. Add spinach, green onions, parsley, cilantro, chives, and fenugreek leaves; cook and stir until deep dark green in color, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir spinach mixture into onion and chuck mixture. Pour in enough water to create a slurry consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer stew until greens soften, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Pierce dried limes with a fork; add to stew. </li>
        <li>Continue simmering until chuck is tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Stir in red kidney beans. Cook until flavors combine, about 30 more minutes. </li>
        <li>Discard dried limes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
